Activity Recording System

This will start of as a training project for web2py. An outline of what we are considering developing is available here:

and it broadly follows the objective that recording activity in a somewhat structured manner may well be quite a powerful approach to changing the activity that takes place.  Our perception is that there remains a fair amount of activity in the world that is less than ideal and if recording it could create an incentive for people to improve their behaviour then that could be worthwhile.
