<p>This system is the product of a great deal of frustration and hard examination of the way the world currently works.
    The primary objectives are to try and identify those who are supporting progress and those that are hindering it.</p>

  <p>While social networking platforms are common we are not convinced they do a fantastic job of highlighting the good
  and bad behaviour going on in the world at present.  They are basically social in purpose in order to sell adverts rather than
      platforms for progress.  They are also to some extent banal.  We have high expectations for medical progress in
  the years ahead, despite the severe structural problems that US healthcare currenlty has.  We also feels it's right
  that midwifes get priority over murderers one donor organ is availabe and both need.  If the principal that behaviour
      should be a factor in healthcare entitlement is accepted the question of how far we go down that route comes into
      play.  We feel this merits discussion but have no idea where society will draw that line.  An activity recording
      system then becomes an essential tool to build up some sort of record of how people have behaved.
      We appreciate there are all sorts of privacy protests that can be made about this sort of system.  However the
      fact is that we are all sharing a single planet and people behaving badly has significant impact on others.
      Consequently it is very reasonable to identify when this is taking place.
  Highlighting bad behaviour should create a new incentive for the perpretrators to change.</p>

    <p> Potentially this is very important.  Extending life expectancy and better sharing of resources has the potential
        to change billions of lives for the better.
        There could be new obligations placed on those with power and wealth to participate and share in the fun,
        however they could be well rewarded for doing so and it should not require coercion to bring them on board.</p>
