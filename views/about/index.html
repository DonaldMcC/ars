<h1>About Activity Recording System</h1>
<p>Inspired by the opportunities ahead and frustrated by the behaviours that hold us back.  This application will allow
    you to report and bear witness to any activity you are aware of taking place in the world.  You may have strong
    views on the merits or undesirability of these activities and you should explain why you have that opinion.
    Just please respect others opinions on the site as well.  We are looking to collate and highlight activities the
    consensus on the best and the worst in each area with a view to encouraging and supporting the good to increase
    their impact and to ensure the bad are aware of the consensus and to encourage them to change their behaviour.</p>
<h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>The approach is based on an open crowdsource platform where people can report activity they like or dislkie and
    others can review, discuss and rate the activity.  Users can select their scope and preferences by geography and
    category.  We have loosely folllowed the top 10 of the UN development goals in setting the categories</p>

<p>At present the system supports the following items: </p>
<ol>
    <li>Activity Reporting</li>
    <li>Rating of reported activities</li>
    <li>Discussion</li>
</ol>

<h1>Privacy</h1>
<p>Personal privacy is important.  This system clearly has potential and definite intention to put a spotlight on
personal activities which could conflict with this.  We will provide facilities to allow people to challenge or
corroborate acitivites and will track the extent of corroboration or dispute attached to any report  We will also not
disclose the source of any reported activity without authorisation.</p>
